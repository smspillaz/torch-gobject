# GObject Bindings for libtorch

Generated from Declarations.yaml

## Requirements

 - [meson](https://github.com/meson-build/meson)
 - [libtorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) from git
 - glib/gio
 - jasmine/gtest for tests
 
## Stability
 
Definitely not API-stable at all. Most of the API is autogenerated.
 
Some of the API depends on fixes to gobject-introspection, gjs and pygi
 
## Usage
 
From GJS-flavour JavaScript:
 
```js
const { GObject, GLib, Torch } = imports.gi;

const tensor = Torch.linspace_double(1.0, 10.0, 10);
log(tensor.get_tensor_data().deep_unpack());
```

Use PyTorch from JavaScript! Sort of useless at the moment.
 
Most of the ATen API is supported. The Torch NN API is not yet supported, but this is being worked on.
